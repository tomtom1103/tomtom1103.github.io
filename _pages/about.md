I'm commited to research in generative models, computer vision, and machine learning. My main interests are in score-based (diffusion) models, conditional generative models, and inverse problems. Advised by Professor [Seoung Bum Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=-ACQ0GAAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=sra) and AI Researcher [Yonghyun Jeong](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=e9pHCjUAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=sra), I've conducted joint research with Professor [Tae-Hyun Oh](https://ami.postech.ac.kr/members/tae-hyun-oh) and Professor [Sungbin Lim](https://www.sungbin-lim.net/) during my master's program.

I enjoy learning about startups, listening to ([and making](https://vibe.naver.com/artist/4057878)) music, and tinkering with computers in my spare time. Feel free to reach out to me via linkedin or mail.
