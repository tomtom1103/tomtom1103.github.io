I'm commited to research in generative models, computer vision, and machine learning. My main interests are in score-based (diffusion) models, conditional generative models, and computational pathology. Advised by Professor [Seoung Bum Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=-ACQ0GAAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=sra) and AI Researcher [Yonghyun Jeong](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=e9pHCjUAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=sra), I've conducted joint research with Professor [Tae-Hyun Oh](https://ami.postech.ac.kr/members/tae-hyun-oh) during my master's program. Currently, I'm working as a research scientist at [Lunit](https://www.lunit.io/en)'s oncology department.

I enjoy [learning about startups](https://www.founderskr.com/), listening to ([and making](https://soundcloud.com/thirdtomcat)) music, and tinkering with computers in my spare time. Feel free to reach out to me via linkedin or mail.
